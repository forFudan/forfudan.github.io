# Introduction
We know that the statistic for the Pearson correlation coefficient follows the *t*-distribution with a degree of freedom of \\(n-2\\). That is to say that

$$t=\frac{r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}(n-2)\sim t_{n-2}.$$

Why?

# Derivation
## Assumptions
Assume that $(X, Y)$ follows a bivariate normal distribution with the parameters $(\mu_X, \mu_Y, \sigma_X, \sigma_Y, \rho)$.
